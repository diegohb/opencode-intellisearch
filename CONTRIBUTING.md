## Making Changes

### Skill Development

Skills are defined in `assets/skills/intellisearch/SKILL.md`.

**SKILL.md Structure:**

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description of when to use this skill
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  audience: agents
  topic: skill-topic
---

## Content
- Skill purpose and capabilities
- When to use
- Quick examples
```

**Frontmatter Requirements:**
- `name`: 1-64 characters, lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens
- `description`: 1-1024 characters, third-person perspective
- `license`: License type
- `compatibility`: "opencode"
- `metadata`: String-to-string map for categorization

**Best Practices:**
- Use gerund form for skill names (e.g., "web-searching")
- Write descriptions in third person
- Keep primary content concise (~150 tokens)
- Use `references/` directory for detailed information
- Follow progressive disclosure pattern

### Command Development

Commands are defined in `assets/commands/search-intelligently.md`.

**Command Structure:**

```markdown
---
description: Command description for TUI list
agent: agent-name
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
temperature: 0.2
---

Command template that becomes the agent prompt.
Use $ARGUMENTS for user input.
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep temperature low (0.1-0.3) for deterministic results
- Use clear, descriptive frontmatter
- Provide examples in command template
- Handle edge cases in template

### Plugin Development

The plugin is located at `plugin.ts`.

**Plugin Structure:**

```typescript
import type { Plugin } from "@opencode-ai/plugin";

const plugin: Plugin = async ({ directory, client }) => ({
  config: async () => {
    // Installation logic here
  },
});

export default plugin;
```

**Key Points:**
- Uses `import.meta.dirname` for package root
- Copies assets from `assets/` to target `.opencode/`
- Uses version marker (`.version`) to prevent duplicate installs
- Returns early if version marker matches current version

## Testing

### Type Checking

```bash
bun run check
```

### Test Locally

```bash
# Link for local testing
bun link

# In test project, link the package
bun link opencode-intellisearch

# Or use path-based testing (recommended)
# Add to test project's opencode.json:
# {
#   "plugins": ["/path/to/opencode-intellisearch"]
# }
```

### Path-Based Testing (Recommended)

1. Configure test project's `opencode.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": ["C:/dev/projects/github/opencode-intellisearch"]
   }
   ```

2. Run test:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/test-project
   opencode run "test hello"
   ```

3. Check OpenCode logs:
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.local/share/opencode/log/`
   - macOS/Linux: `~/.local/share/opencode/log/`

4. Verify assets installed:
   ```bash
   ls .opencode/skills/intellisearch/
    ls .opencode/commands/search-intelligently.md
   ```

### Test Cross-Platform

- Test on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Test fresh install (no `.version` marker)
- Test version skip (existing `.version` marker)
- Test with different OpenCode versions

### Test Skill Behavior

1. Install skill
2. Create test queries for each category:
   - Code/technology queries
   - News queries
   - Company queries
   - Person queries
   - Research queries
3. Verify routing decisions
4. Check fallback behavior when MCP servers unavailable
5. Test memory caching (if configured)

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b ai-your-feature-name
```

All branches must start with `ai-`.

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Edit files in `assets/` directory for skills/commands
- Edit `plugin.ts` for plugin logic
- Test thoroughly
- Update documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md

### 3. Type Check

```bash
bun run check
```

Ensure no TypeScript errors.

### 4. Commit Changes

```bash
git add plugin.ts
git commit -m "feat: add new routing feature

- Description of what changed
- Why it was changed
- References any related issues"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- Use conventional commits
- First line: 50 chars or less
- Subsequent lines: more detail
- Branch names must start with `ai-`

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin ai-your-feature-name
```

### 6. Create Pull Request

- Go to GitHub repository
- Click "Pull Requests"
- Click "New Pull Request"
- Select your branch
- Fill in PR template
- Submit for review

### 7. Address Feedback

- Respond to review comments
- Make requested changes
- Push updates to your branch
- Ensure `bun run check` still passes

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use **named functions** (not arrow functions) where no `this` scoping issues
- Target: ESNext, Module: ESNext
- Strict mode enabled
- Always use explicit return types on exported functions
- Prefer `async/await` over callbacks
- **Bun-native**: Import with `.ts` extensions

### Imports

```typescript
// Node built-ins first (use node: prefix)
import { mkdir, copyFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";

// External dependencies
import type { Plugin } from "@opencode-ai/plugin";

// Internal modules (include .ts extension for Bun)
import { default as plugin } from "./plugin.ts";
```

### Naming Conventions

- Functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `copyDirectory`, `installAssets`)
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `VERSION`)
- Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PluginContext`)
- Files: `kebab-case.ts`

### Markdown Files

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use sentence case for headings
- Include blank line before headings
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifier
- Use relative paths for file references
- Use forward slashes for all paths

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Third-person description
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  audience: agents
  topic: category
---
```

### Command Frontmatter

```yaml
---
description: Command description
agent: agent-name
model: model-id
temperature: 0.2
---
```
